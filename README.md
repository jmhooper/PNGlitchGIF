# Intro

PNGlitchGIF is a tool based off of [PNGlitch](https://github.com/ucnv/pnglitch) by [ucnv](https://github.com/ucnv/).

PNGlitchGIF works by applying PNGlitch to an image multiple times with increasing then decreasing intensity.
The results are stored in the directory named `frames`.
The frames can then be used to created an animated GIF like the one seen below:
